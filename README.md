## Machine-learning-based-stock-trading-bot

Our project aims to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of three key technical indicators in predicting stock prices. Here’s our structured approach:

# Manual Strategy Construction:
We will construct a manual trading strategy based on technical indicators.
Our goal is to compare this manual strategy against a benchmark to assess its performance.
If the indicators consistently signal optimal buy and sell times, our manual strategy should outperform the benchmark.
# Machine Learning Approach: Random Forest-Based Learner, Q-Learner, and other learners:
We’ll employ machine learning techniques to create a robust learner using the same technical indicators.
By rigorously testing its performance, we’ll determine whether these indicators indeed possess predictive power.
Anticipating success, we expect the strategy learner to outperform the benchmark both in-sample (historical data) and out-of-sample (future data).
# Real-Time Trading Bot Implementation:
Building upon our findings from the experiments, we’ll develop a real-time stock trading bot.
This bot will utilize the ETrade API and Yahoo Finance API for seamless execution.
Our ultimate goal is to achieve consistent and profitable trading outcomes.
